# Bilbob 

**Bilbob** is a social media for your pets! All animals are welcomed! 🐱🐶🐟🐦🐢 All requests are served by our **Gopher**! 🦦 Free yourselves from the negativity of mainstream social media! 🤩

On a more serious note, I only did this project to try out backend development. Here is a list of technologies used to develop this project:
- [**Go**](https://go.dev) 🦦 with **net/http** and [**Gin**](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework 🍸
- **JS/HTML/CSS** with [**React**](https://react.dev) library ⚛️
- [**PostgresSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) 🐘
- [**Podman**](https://podman.io/) 🦭 / [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) 🐋

**Bilbob** is live at [bilbob.fuadismail.com](http://bilbob.fuadismail.com). See the [Safety concerns](#safety-concerns) below to understand the safety concerns of your data.
